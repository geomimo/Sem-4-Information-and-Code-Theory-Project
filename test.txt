In statistical mechanics, entropy is an extensive property of a thermodynamic system. 

It is closely related to the number O of microscopic configurations (known as microstates) that are consistent with the macroscopic quantities 
that characterize the system (such as its volume, pressure and temperature). Under the assumption that each microstate is equally probable, 
the entropy S is the natural logarithm of the number of microstates, multiplied by the Boltzmann constant kB. Formally (assuming equiprobable microstates).

Macroscopic systems typically have a very large number O of possible microscopic configurations. For example, the entropy of an ideal gas is proportional to 
the number of gas molecules N. The number of molecules in twenty liters of gas at room temperature and atmospheric pressure is roughly N = 6*1023 (the Avogadro number). 
At equilibrium, each of the O = eN configurations can be regarded as random and equally likely.

The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases over time. Such systems spontaneously evolve towards thermodynamic equilibrium, 
the state with maximum entropy. Non-isolated systems may lose entropy, provided their environment's entropy increases by at least that amount so that the total entropy increases. 
Entropy is a function of the state of the system, so the change in entropy of a system is determined by its initial and final states. In the idealization that a process is reversible, 
the entropy does not change, while irreversible processes always increase the total entropy.

Because it is determined by the number of random microstates, entropy is related to the amount of additional information needed to specify the exact physical state of a system, given 
its macroscopic specification. For this reason, it is often said that entropy is an expression of the disorder, or randomness of a system, or of the lack of information about it. 
The concept of entropy plays a central role in information theory.

Boltzmann's constant, and therefore entropy, have dimensions of energy divided by temperature, which has a unit of joules per kelvin in the International System of Units. The entropy 
of a substance is usually given as an intensive property either entropy per unit mass or entropy per unit 
amount of substance.
